# OneTimePassword

### Live version:
onetimepassword.apphb.com

### Developed with:
  - Visual Studio 2013
  - .NET Framework 4.5
  - ASP.NET MVC 4

### Known issue:
The way the algorithm uses the defined time-step interval to calculate the token may lead to a password being generated to close to the transition to the next interval, resulting in it being valid for less time than the expected.
This is a known issue for the algorithm, and the rfc 6238 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238#section-5.2) suggests using a window of 1 step to overcome this.
I decided not to do that because it has the potencial to make a password valid for more time than the requested interval.
So, in practice, any token generated by this program will be valid for less than the requested interval, due to the chance of it being generated somewhere in the middle of the time-stipe and due to the gap between generation and the arrival of the token for validation.
